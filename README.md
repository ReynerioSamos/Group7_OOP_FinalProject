Vehicle Rental System


A customer would be able to rent a vehicle through a clerk who would also approve it for a daily rate.
They could also contact a suitable driver to also be included in the bill.


Customers can be Individuals or Companies

Persons are either employees, drivers, or technicians
Employees are either administrators, managers, clerks or maintenance

Vehicles can be a Car, Truck, Bus or Motorbike

Customers talk to a clerk when renting a vehicle who would make and be able to approve a rental request form which includes the customer, vehicle, number of days, rate, clerk who approved, date approved, date to be returned and driver if requested.

Clerks would also be able to make vehicle maintenance requests as well as vehicle repair requests
